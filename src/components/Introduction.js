                    Hi, I'm Kevin! I'm a third-year Computer Science student at Georgia Tech with a passion for full-stack engineering and web development. 
                    I love building apps that not only work well but also make an impact on the people who use them.

                    I'm always excited to learn new technologies and take on challenges that push me to grow. 
                    Whether it's creating sleek, user-friendly interfaces or building out efficient backends, I enjoy every part of the process that brings ideas to life.

                    Outside of coding, I'm always looking for ways to get creative and explore how technology can solve real-world problems.
